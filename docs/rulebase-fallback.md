# Rule-based Fallback

If AI integration is not set up or temporarily unavailable, the plugin will automatically use rule-based recommendations.

- Rule-based logic can suggest best-sellers, new arrivals, or products from the same category.
- This ensures your customers always see relevant suggestions.
- You can customize the fallback rules in the plugin settings.
