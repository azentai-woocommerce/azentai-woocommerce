# FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: Do I need an AI API key to use the plugin?**  
A: No, the plugin will use rule-based recommendations if you do not set up AI.

**Q: Can I customize where recommendations appear?**  
A: Yes, you can choose locations in the plugin settings or use shortcodes/widgets.

**Q: What if recommendations are not showing?**  
A: Check your plugin settings, make sure the blocks are enabled, and clear your site cache.

**Q: Is the plugin compatible with all themes?**  
A: The plugin is designed to work with most WooCommerce themes. For custom themes, you may need to adjust CSS.

**Q: How do I translate the plugin into my language?**  
A: All texts and labels are i18n-ready. You can use popular translation plugins like Loco Translate or WPML to add your own translations.

**Q: Why are my AI recommendations not updating?**  
A: Make sure your AI provider is set up correctly and your API key (if using OpenAI) is valid. Also, check if your site/server cache needs to be cleared.

**Q: Are there any usage limits with AzentAI or OpenAI?**  
A: For OpenAI, you can set your own daily API call limit. AzentAI may have usage limits during the development phase—see the General tab for details.

**Q: Will the plugin slow down my site?**  
A: The plugin is optimized for performance and uses Vue.js to handle dynamic loading from the API, which helps minimize any impact on your website speed. However, using external AI providers may add a slight delay depending on your server and network speed.

**Q: Can I use custom CSS to style the recommendations?**  
A: Yes, you can add custom CSS in the plugin’s display settings for each recommendation block.

**Q: Why are my recommendations not changing after I update products or settings?**  
A: This may be due to the "Recommendation Lifetime" setting, which controls how long recommendations are cached for each user. Try reducing the lifetime or clearing your site cache to see updates sooner.

**Q: What if my recommendations are not relevant or effective?**  
A: If you’re not satisfied with the results, try switching between AzentAI and OpenAI in the General tab. Different AI engines may provide better results depending on your store and data.

**Q: How long does it take for the plugin to learn and provide accurate recommendations?**  
A: The plugin starts tracking user behavior and product interactions immediately, but more accurate and personalized recommendations will improve over time as more data is collected from your store’s visitors.

**Q: Who can I contact for support?**  
A: Please use the support link in the plugin dashboard or visit our website for documentation and help.
