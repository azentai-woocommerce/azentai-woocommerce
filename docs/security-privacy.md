# Security & Privacy

## Data Handling Policy

AzentAI is designed with privacy and security as top priorities. We are committed to protecting your store’s and your customers’ data.

### What Data is Sent

- **User Data:**  
  By default, AzentAI does **not** send any personal information (such as name, email, or phone number) to external APIs. If you wish to include such data, you must explicitly enable this option in the plugin settings.

- **Behavioral Data:**  
  Only product IDs related to user actions (such as viewed products, products added to cart, purchased products, and wishlist items) are sent for generating recommendations. No personal identifiers are included.

- **Product Data:**  
  Only non-sensitive product information is sent: product ID, category, and price.

### External APIs

- The only external API endpoints used are:
  - `https://api.azentlabs.com/api/` (AzentAI Cloud)
  - OpenAI API (if enabled and configured by the admin)
- All data is transmitted securely over HTTPS.

### Your Control

- Store admins have full control over what data is shared with external APIs.
- You can choose to use AzentAI Cloud, OpenAI, or keep all data local.
- All data sharing is transparent and can be reviewed in the plugin settings.

### Compliance

- AzentAI does **not** collect, store, or transmit any sensitive customer information by default.
- The plugin is fully compliant with WordPress and WooCommerce security best practices.
