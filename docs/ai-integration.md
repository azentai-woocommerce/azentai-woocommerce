# AI & API Integration

To use AI-powered recommendations, you need to connect the plugin to your AI provider (such as OpenAI).

- Go to the plugin settings and enter your API key.
- Choose your preferred AI model and adjust any advanced options if available.
- Test the connection to make sure everything is working.
- If you do not set up AI, the plugin will automatically use rule-based recommendations.
