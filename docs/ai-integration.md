# AI & API Integration

To use AI-powered recommendations, you need to connect the plugin to your preferred AI provider. The plugin supports two options:

---

### AzentAI

AzentAI is a self-trained, in-house AI engine developed specifically for product recommendations.  
- **No API key required.**
- Runs on our own infrastructure and does not rely on third-party providers.
- Optimized for e-commerce and privacy.

> **Note:** AzentAI is currently under active development and optimization. Please consider this when enabling the service, as features and performance may change in future updates.

---

### OpenAI

OpenAI is a leading AI platform offering powerful and up-to-date language models.
- Enter your own OpenAI API key in the plugin settings.
- Choose from the latest AI models (such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, etc.).
- Take full advantage of OpenAIâ€™s advanced capabilities for product recommendations.

If you do not set up an AI provider, the plugin will automatically use rule-based recommendations.
