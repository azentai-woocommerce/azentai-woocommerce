# Plugin Configuration

After installing the plugin, go to **Smart Product AI** in your WordPress admin dashboard. The settings are organized into several intuitive tabs:

---

## General Tab

This tab lets you choose which AI engine will power your product recommendations.  
You can select between **AzentAI** (our self-trained, in-house AI optimized for e-commerce) or **OpenAI**.

- **AzentAI:** No API key required. Uses a private, self-trained AI model for recommendations.
- **OpenAI:** Enter your own API key, select the AI model you want to use, and set a daily usage limit for full control over costs and performance.

---

## AI Recommendations Tab

This dashboard provides an overview of all three AI recommendation types available in the plugin:

- **AI Product Recommendations**
- **AI Personalized Recommendations**
- **AI Cross-sell/Upsell**

For each type, you can see key stats and quickly access the **Settings** button to configure detailed options for that specific recommendation engine.

Adjust each tab according to your storeâ€™s needs, then save your changes to apply the configuration.
